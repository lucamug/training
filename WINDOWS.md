# To use on Windows

* Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Install NodeJs and the npm modules as explained in the [README.md](README.md).

In Windows is better to use the Git Bash terminal (installed together with git) instead of the Windows shell.

If the commands installed with npm are not working, is probably because the path is missing.
